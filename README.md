So far, we have seen and used two key virtualization concepts of modern operating systems: the process and the memory address space. Our programs have been mainly built around processes and threads where interactions and data-exchange between those occur within the virtualized memory space, which is typically volatile (e.g., mapped to the RAM memory). Thus, all of our program‚Äôs data is lost when our programs terminate, either normally or due to unexpected events such as critical errors or system power loss. Additionally, the interaction of our programs with the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù world has been restricted to input-output (I/O) transactions on the user‚Äôs

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Files are one of the key abstractions developed over time for the virtualization of storage. A file is nothing more than a simple linear array of bytes, typically on non- volatile storage, that can be read from or written to. The operating system (OS) takes the entire responsibility on knowing how these bytes are accessed and stored in a given media (e.g., magnetic hard disk) so the user does not need to know or worry about low-level details such as cylinders, tracks, sectors, and other pesky (hard-to-

<div class="column">
Files are normally organized into directories, another type of an abstraction provided

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
by the operating system. Directories are treated by most operating systems as special files whose content is essentially a list of files and some metadata (e.g., the kind of file, user permissions, etc.). Both files and directories have associated user- readable names (e.g., foo and bar.txt) and low-level name used and managed by the operating system itself (often known as its inode number). Files and directories can be organized into a hierarchical-tree-like structure ‚Äì the directory tree (example of the figure below). In Unix-based systems, the root directory under which the directory structure storing all files and directories resides is named ‚Äú/‚Äù. In UNIX-like operating systems, users can explore and navigate through the aforementioned file system

Files are a natural mechanism of communication between processes. Given their persistence, files can hold information written by one process and read by another one at a later time.

Exercise 5: Complete the functions: main(), oddNumbersConsumer() and evenNumbersConsumer() so the process operates as intended. An important detail: both tasks must read from the same file, concurrently, and each of them must process every stored number. That is, if the file contains the sequence [1, 7, 6], both threads should read numbers 1, 7, and 6, and process them accordingly. Recall how file descriptors track the progress within the file in hand, and think of a way to

1. Building and using loadable kernel modules

When you boot your Linux machine (or VM), a series of LKMs to control multiple aspects of your system are already probably loaded4 and running. You can get a list with all modules by executing the lsmod command. Note that all commands to manage LKMs can only be executed using elevated privileges (either by logging in as root or using the sudo command, which is more common, e.g., sudo lsmod). Typically, ordinary users do not have permissions to ‚Äúmess‚Äù with kernel-related stuff.

4 The compiled LKM modules for most Linux distros are typically found under the /lib/modules/$kernel- version$/ folder.

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Let‚Äôs now have a look on how to build our first LKM; a basic skeleton is shown in the following code snippet.

Tutorial Program Btp3-1 (full code @hello.c)

A kernel module must implement at least two functions: an initialization function, called when the module is loaded into the kernel, and a cleanup function, called upon module unloading. In the example above, we can see the function hello_init() being declared by the pseudo-macro module_init() as the module‚Äôs initialization function. Similarly, function hello_exit() is declared by module_exit() as the module‚Äôs cleanup function. Modules can optionally include miscellaneous metadata concerning, for example, the type of license (macro MODULE_LICENSE) and author (MODULE_AUTHOR). Users can use the modinfo command to read this information from compiled modules.

LKM functions are part of the kernel and as such, it is not possible to use the standard C libraries as we have been doing for our previous user-space programs. Hence, we cannot call C library functions like printf(). Instead, modules can only call functions belonging to the kernel API. In the code example above, the printk() kernel function replaces the functionality of printf()5. You can also find kernel functions to dynamically allocate memory, write to files, etc.

Due to their nature, LKMs are compiled differently from regular user-space applications (e.g., should not be linked to libraries, must be compiled with the same options as the kernel, etc.). We will not dwell into details on this topic. For each

5 Note: the information printed by printk() is not typically seen under the user console, but sent to a special kernel buffer that can be consulted, for example, using the dmesg command. Additionally, printk() defines multiple log levels (KERN_EMERG, KERN_ALERT, ‚Ä¶, KERN_INFO, KERN_DEBUG) that denote the importance of the message. Consult the printk() documentation for more info.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 11">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
exercise, a build script (a file named Makefile) will be provided that can be used by the make utility command to build the LKM.

The building process of a LKM results in a number of output files, among which, a .ko file, the object file with the built kernel module. Built modules can be installed (loaded) using the insmod utility command and the respective .ko file. A module can be uninstalled (unloaded) by invoking the rmmod utility with the module‚Äôs name as command argument (the module name is typically the name of the .ko file, without the file extension).

Exercise 1

Download the hello.c and Makefile files to your virtual machine (or shared folder between host OS and virtual machine). Open the Makefile file. At the end you will see the line obj-m := hello.o ; this instructs the build tool to create several output files, including hello.ko, the object file with the hello kernel module. Now, try to build your LKM by invoking the make utility command inside the directory that contains both hello.c and Makefile files.

After successfully building the module, use the modinfo utility to confirm that the metadata is as expected. Next, load the module into the kernel and confirm that it is indeed loaded by executing the command lsmod | grep hello (check grep if you want to know what this does). Verify that the ‚ÄúHello, world‚Äù message has been logged. When done, unload the module and confirm that the operation was successful. Confirm that the expected message is logged upon removing the module.

2. Creating a device driver ‚Äì the echo pseudo device driver

After knowing the basics on how to create an LKM and use it, we will now develop a device driver that just writes to the console what is written to the pseudo device (we call this a pseudo device because it does not control any I/O device, not physical not even virtual).

In Linux systems, devices mostly fall into one of two categories: character and block devices. Whereas the latter category allows accessing data in independent ‚Äúblocks‚Äù, the former allows data to be retrieved only as a stream of characters and bytes. Nevertheless, both device types are accessed through names in the filesystem, corresponding to special files or device files6. These device files are conventionally located in the /dev directory. If you issue (try it!) the ls -l command for this directory, you will see something akin to the next image snapshot, where device files for character and block devices are identified by a ‚Äúc‚Äù and a ‚Äúb‚Äù in the first column, respectively.

6 Recall the UNIX saying that goes ‚ÄúOn a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process.‚Äù

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 12">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
You can also see two numbers separated by a comma. These numbers are known as the major (leftmost) and minor (rightmost) device numbers, used by the kernel to identify a particular device. The major number identifies the driver associated with the device. In the snapshot above, devices /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS1 (the virtual consoles) are both managed by driver 4. The kernel uses the major number at open time to dispatch execution to the appropriate device driver. The minor number is only used by the driver itself, not by the kernel, and is commonly used to identify a single device out of several (a device driver can control several devices, as shown in the above snapshot).

Note: The kernel also keeps a list with all the currently assigned major device numbers in the /proc/devices file; you can run the command cat /proc/devices to see its contents.

2.1. Allocation of a device number

When building an LKM for a device driver, users can either request the assignment of pre-defined major/minor device numbers (static assignment) or let the kernel assign them dynamically. Nowadays, major device numbers are commonly assigned dynamically to avoid picking an existing number. For example, device drivers for character devices can request their device numbers from the kernel with the alloc_chrdev_region() function (defined in &lt;linux/fs.h&gt;). The function returns a kernel data structure type dev_t (defined in &lt;linux/types.h&gt;) that holds both numbers. The LKM can use the macros MAJOR(dev_t dev) and MINOR(dev_t dev) to obtain the major and minor numbers, respectively. Upon unloading, LKMs should release the allocated device numbers. For character devices, this is done by invoking the unregister_chrdev_region() function.

Exercise 2

The next code snippet belongs to the source code of the device driver we are going to develop throughout the remainder of this section.

Tutorial Program Btp3-2 (full code @echo.c)

Download all the necessary files (echo.c and Makefile), and complete the echo_init() and echo_exit() functions so the device driver is properly registered/unregistered, and the described log messages displayed on the kernel log buffer. Verify that you are able to load and unload the module to the kernel properly, and that the major device number is freed (see the /proc/devices file).

2.2. Creation of the device file

So far, we have developed a module that is able to register and obtain a valid device number from the kernel. However, after loading the module, you might have found (if not, try it now) that no device file for our echo driver has been created under the /dev directory! This is normal, as the device file is not created automatically. Indeed, dynamically allocating the major number has a disadvantage: you can‚Äôt create the device files in advance as the major number assigned to the module can‚Äôt be guaranteed to always be the same. One way around this problem is to write a script that immediately creates7 the required device files after loading the device driver. This is possible as the kernel logs all the assigned major device numbers in the /proc/devices file; you can run the command cat /proc/devices to have a look into it (try it with and without your module loaded). Similarly to the compilation of kernel modules, we will not dwell on the details concerning the development of such scripts; these will also be provided to you throughout the next exercises.

2.3. Interacting with device files

Now that we have a device file associated with our driver, we can start interacting with it. As you may recall from Part A of this script, we have used a set of system calls such as open(), close(), write(), and read() to perform multiple operations on a file from programs living in user-space. In Linux, these same calls can be used for any kind of file, device files included! However, before these can be used, they must be implemented and registered by the respective device driver in kernel space. In the following section, we will see how a (character) device driver can register its supported system call operations and how they are linked to its implementations by the driver. Afterward, we will see how to implement the most common operations using our driver: open(), close(), write(), and read().

2.3.1. Registering character devices and their operations

Internally, the kernel uses structures of type struct cdev (&lt;linux/cdev.h&gt;) to represent a char device and their capabilities. Therefore, before the kernel can be able to invoke the operations of a given device, the driver must allocate and register one (or more) of these structures. A driver can allocate a new cdev using the cdev_alloc() function.

A cdev structure contains two members: (i) owner, used to point to the kernel module to which the driver belongs (always set with the macro THIS_MODULE ), (ii) ops, a pointer to a structure of type struct file_operations (&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;). This last structure specifies the different operations required to implement system calls such as open() and read() supported by the device driver. Essentially, it contains a set of pointers to functions defined by the driver, each of which implements the operations required for the implementation of a given system call. You can find a detailed description of this structure in Ch. 3 of the LDD3 book, page 49 and following.

After creating and initializing the cdev structure, the device driver must register it in the kernel by invoking the cdev_add() function. As the main purpose of this device registration is to ‚Äútell‚Äù the kernel which operations are supported by the device, it should be done within the driver‚Äôs initialization function. Similarly, the driver‚Äôs cleanup function should remove from the system all cdev structures it has previously registered; this can be done by using the cdev_del() function.

2.3.2. Implementing open() and close()

As you may recall from Part A of this script, in Linux, a file (of any kind) must first be opened by an application before performing any operations on it. Likewise, an application must close an opened file once done using it. In this section, we will learn how to implement the necessary functionality in our driver for the support of the open() and close() system calls.

Drivers can implement the open file operation to be invoked every time an open() system call is executed. This operation is used to perform any initialization, device- specific procedures in preparation for later operations on the device. In most drivers, the open operation should perform the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Check for device-specific status and errors (e.g., device-not-ready);</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Initialize the device if being opened for the first time;</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Update the reading/writing position, if necessary (recall file offsets from
part‚Å†‚Å£‚Å¢‚Å† A in this project script);
</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;Allocate and fill any auxiliary control data structures (e.g., state information).
The prototype for the open operation is:

int open(struct inode *inodep, struct file *filep);

Note: driver‚Äôs operation methods are invoked by the kernel upon certain events such as when a given process invokes a system call. Therefore, the arguments of these methods are used by the kernel to pass relevant information into the driver implementation.

The first order of business is usually to identify which device is being opened (recall that a driver can control multiple devices). As we have seen in the previous section, devices are registered using the cdev structure. However, from the open prototype

8 Why do we see such a message? In summary, the executed command line command tries to write ‚Äú1‚Äù to the file /dev/echo ‚Ä¶ our device file! Recall that before being able to write to a file, it must first be opened using the system call open(). Well, that‚Äôs what happened here! However, since we didn‚Äôt implement the support for it in our driver, yet, ‚Ä¶ the command stops dead there and no write() operation is even tried üôÇ

we see that such structure type is not provided. Instead, two new structures are available:

<ul>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;struct inode ‚Äì This structure represents a file, a regular or a special file. Note that even though a given file may be opened simultaneously by different processes, the kernel keeps a single struct inode. Among other members, this struct includes the member struct cdev *i_cdev that points to the cdev struct of the corresponding device. This is all you need to know for this project about the inode structure. You can find detailed information on this structure in Ch. 3 of the LDD3 book, on page 55;</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;struct file ‚Äì It represents a file descriptor, which is returned on an open system call. Among other members, this struct includes the member void *private_data that can be used by a device driver to maintain state information across system calls. For this project, this is all you need to know about the file structure. Detailed description on this structure is available in Ch. 3 of the LDD3 book, on page 53 and following.
Because some operations provided by the device driver, such as read and write, do not take as argument the address of a struct inode, but only the address of a struct file, the private_data member of the struct file is initialized during the open method with the address of the corresponding struct cdev.

For the close() system call, device drivers implement the release operation whose prototype is as follows:

int release(struct inode *inodep, struct file *filep);

Here, the arguments are the same as for the open operation, and this operation usually undoes what the open operation has done (e.g., free data structures). Note that not every invocation of the close() system call leads to the invocation of the release operation. If you want some operation to be performed on every invocation of the close() system call, define a flush file operation, which is indeed invoked on every close system call. A more detailed discussion of these issues can be found in Ch. 3 of the LDD3 book, on page 59.

<li>‚óè &nbsp;read ‚Äì returns how many characters have been written out by all applications to the device since the last time it was loaded.
The prototypes of the aforementioned operations are as follows:

ssize_t read(struct file *filep, char __user *buff, size_t count, loff_t *offp);

ssize_t write(struct file *filep, const char __user *buff, size_t count, loff_t *offp);

filep is the file pointer, buff is a buffer used to transfer data either from user space to the kernel or vice-versa, count is the size of the requested transfer, offp is a pointer to a long offset type object that indicates the file position the user is accessing. The offp argument is needed because device drivers are not aware of the file position: it is maintained by the file system layer. Nevertheless, so that that layer can update the file structure, usually the code should update the file position at *offp accordingly after the data transfer.

In the case of the echo device, seeking does not make sense, hence there is no need to keep the file position. Because the default implementation of the operation allows seeking, the open operation must invoke the function:

extern int nonseekable_open(struct inode * inode, struct file * filp);

This way, the kernel will prevent an lseek() system call from succeeding. In addition, the llseek operation of the struct file_operations should be set to the special helper function no_llseek .

Both read and write should return the number of bytes transferred, if the operation is successful. Otherwise, if no byte is successfully transferred, then they should return a negative number. However, if there is an error after successfully transferring some bytes, both should return the number of bytes transferred, and an error code in the following call of the function. This requires the device driver to recall the occurrence of an error from a call to the next. However, the echo device driver needs not worry with partial success because it will always succeed in performing those operations.

Both in read() and in write(), the buff argument is a pointer to user space, and should not be directly dereferenced by kernel code. (An explanation of why this is so can be found in Ch. 3 of the LDD3 book, on pages 63 and 64.) Instead, you can use the following kernel functions, which are defined in &lt;asm/uaccess.h&gt;:

unsigned long copy_to_user(void __user *to,const void *from,unsigned long count);

unsigned long copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from, unsigned long count);

<div class="column">
In this section we will strengthen our knowledge of the device driver creation process by creating a pipe device, i.e., a FIFO that can be written by one process and read by another. Linux already implements what are commonly known as Unix pipes represented in the shell input with the character ‚Äò|‚Äô. These pipes are a way of connecting the output of a process to the input of another one, thus allowing their execution in a chain. These are extremely useful in scripting and allow creating

In our case, we will design a device driver that implements the pipe functionality. In particular, it will implement a circular buffer (see the last exercise of lab assignment two) that can be opened by a producer or a consumer process and allow them to
